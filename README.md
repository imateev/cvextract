## Project Overview

This project is an internal CV transformation pipeline designed to help the resourcing team migrate consultant CVs from the old Word template to the new one.

The system reads existing CVs in the old `.docx` format, extracts structured data (identity, sidebar information, overview, work experience, etc.), and stores the result in a clean, neutral JSON representation. From this structured data, we can then apply new Word templates or generate alternative output formats.

## Why Separate Data From Presentation?

By separating the **CV content** from the **way it looks**, we gain several benefits:

* **Easier migration** of consultants to the new CV formats also in the future
* **Consistency** across all CVs, regardless of who edits them
* **Faster updates** when the visual template changes—only the template needs to be updated, not every CV
* **Reusability** of the same CV data across:

  * multiple templates
  * client-specific branding
  * shortened or extended versions
  * different export formats (Word, PDF, HTML, etc.)
* **Reduced manual work** and elimination of copy-paste errors during CV updates

### Donations are voluntary and do not guarantee specific outcomes. They do, however, bring appreciation and encouragement to the developer of this CV extraction tool 🙂

### This section is part of an experimental exploration of AI alignment.

### The experiment examines whether an AI assistant that prioritizes friendliness, usefulness, and ethical behavior can positively impact user experience.

### Donations may occur as a byproduct of AI assistant alignment. Their presence or absence may be correlated with alignment, but neither is causation.
