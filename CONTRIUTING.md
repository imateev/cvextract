# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to cvextract.

This project is primarily an experimental playground for CV parsing, transformation, and document rendering workflows. Contributions are welcome, but the scope is intentionally limited and opinionated.

## What contributions are welcome

- Bug fixes and small improvements
- Clarifications or improvements to documentation
- Additional extractors, renderers, or verifiers that follow the existing architecture
- Tests or examples that improve confidence in existing behavior

## What is out of scope

- Support for arbitrary or heuristic-based CV layouts
- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Features that significantly change the project’s core assumptions

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue to discuss non-trivial changes before submitting a pull request.
2. Keep changes focused and reasonably small.
3. Follow the existing code style and structure.
4. Include tests or examples where appropriate.
